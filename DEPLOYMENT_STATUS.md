# CMON DAO - Native MON Deployment Status

## ✅ What We Fixed

1. **Understood the Issue** - You were 100% right, we should use NATIVE MON (gas token), not a fake ERC20
2. **Created New Contracts** - `CMONStakingNative.sol` that accepts native MON
3. **Started Deployment** - CMON Token deployed successfully!

## 📊 Deployment Progress

### ✅ Completed
- CMON Token: `0xe4907F607a20cC4DD7215099A7E72c8C4033c161`

### ⏳ In Progress
- CMONStakingNative (RPC timeout - Monad testnet is overloaded)
- CMONGovernance (pending)

## 🔧 The Issue

Monad testnet RPC is currently overloaded:
```
ProviderError: failure to submit eth_call to thread pool: queue size exceeded
```

This is a network issue, not a code issue.

## 🚀 Solutions

### Option 1: Wait and Retry
The Monad testnet is experiencing high load. Try again in a few minutes:
```bash
npm run deploy:native
```

### Option 2: Use Alternative RPC
Try Ankr's RPC endpoint:
```javascript
// In hardhat.config.js
url: "https://rpc.ankr.com/monad_testnet"
```

### Option 3: Deploy Manually
Since CMON Token is already deployed, you can deploy the staking contract separately:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-staking-only.js --network monad
```

## 📝 What's Different with Native MON

### Old (Wrong) Approach
```solidity
IERC20 monToken;  // Fake ERC20 token
monToken.transferFrom(user, address(this), amount);
```

### New (Correct) Approach
```solidity
function stake() external payable {  // Accepts native MON
    // msg.value contains the native MON sent
    cmonToken.mint(msg.sender, msg.value);
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Wait for RPC** - Monad testnet is busy, try again in 5-10 minutes
2. **Complete Deployment** - Run `npm run deploy:native` again
3. **Update Frontend** - Change to send native MON instead of ERC20
4. **Test** - Stake your actual MON balance!

## 💡 Key Changes Needed in Frontend

```javascript
// OLD (ERC20 approach)
await monToken.approve(staking, amount);
await staking.stake(amount);

// NEW (Native MON approach)
await staking.stake({ value: amount });  // Send MON directly
```

## Current Contracts

**Already Deployed:**
- CMON Token: `0xe4907F607a20cC4DD7215099A7E72c8C4033c161`

**Ready to Deploy (when RPC works):**
- CMONStakingNative.sol
- CMONGovernance.sol

---

**Status**: Partially deployed, waiting for Monad RPC to recover from high load.
