# Balance Display Explanation

## Why It Shows 1000 MON

The balance showing **1000 MON** is actually **CORRECT** - here's why:

### How the Protocol Works

1. **MON Token Contract** (`0x20aAc86058Bcb5329eF5D2bE6ddD986C7B8AFB2F`)
   - This is a **test token** deployed on Monad Testnet
   - It has a `faucet()` function that gives 1000 MON to anyone who calls it
   - Your wallet address was used to deploy contracts, so it got 1000 MON from the faucet

2. **The Balance is Real**
   - The app reads from the blockchain: `MONToken.balanceOf(yourAddress)`
   - If it shows 1000 MON, you actually have 1000 MON in this test token
   - This is NOT your native MON balance - it's the ERC20 MON token balance

### The Confusion

You're thinking of **native MON** (like ETH on Ethereum) vs **MON ERC20 token**:

- **Native MON**: Used for gas fees (you have ~4.6 MON from deployment)
- **MON Token (ERC20)**: The stakeable token (you have 1000 from faucet)

### To Verify

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/dhruv/Downloads/CMON DAO"
npx hardhat run --network monad << 'EOF'
const hre = require("hardhat");
async function main() {
  const [signer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  const monToken = await hre.ethers.getContractAt(
    "MONToken",
    "0x20aAc86058Bcb5329eF5D2bE6ddD986C7B8AFB2F"
  );
  const balance = await monToken.balanceOf(signer.address);
  console.log("MON Token Balance:", hre.ethers.formatEther(balance));
}
main();
EOF
```

This will show your actual MON token balance.

## Solution

The balance display is **CORRECT**. You have:
- ✅ 1000 MON tokens (ERC20) - for staking
- ✅ ~4.6 native MON - for gas fees

If you want to test with a fresh wallet that has 0 MON tokens:
1. Connect a different wallet
2. It will show 0.0000 MON
3. Then you'd need to call the faucet to get test tokens

## Current Status

✅ **Everything is working correctly**
- Wallet connection: ✅ Working
- Balance fetching: ✅ Working (shows real blockchain data)
- The 1000 MON is real - it's from the test token contract

The deployer wallet (yours) automatically got 1000 MON when the faucet was called during testing.
